# IdentityManager for React Native
The `IdentityManager` provides functionalities to React Native applications to interact with device and subscriber identity information on Android devices. It allows the retrieval of phone numbers for the default SIM, screen resolution, and generates a unique identifier using secure hashing mechanisms.

## Dependencies
This module depends on the React Native framework and uses Android's 'TelephonyManager' and 'SubscriptionManager' APIs and various other system services. Make sure to have the `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission in your application.

## Methods
To use the `IdentityManager` in your React Native application, you need to add it to the list of native modules in your Android project and exposes the below methods to React Native:

### getDefaultPhoneNumber
Fetches the phone number associated with the default SIM card. It checks for permissions and Android API level compatibility to retrieve the phone number.

### generateIdentifier
Takes in an input of a `Phone Number` and generates a secure, hashed identifier based on system time, screen resolution, phone number, and randomly generated bytes. This method provides an additional layer of anonymity and security by not directly using any personally identifiable information.

## Example Usage
```java
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { IdentityManager } = NativeModules;

IdentityManager.getDefaultPhoneNumber()
  .then(phoneNumber => console.log('Phone Number:', phoneNumber))
  .catch(error => console.error('Failed to fetch phone number:', error));

const phoneNumber = '1234567890'; // Example phone number
IdentityManager.generateIdentifier(phoneNumber)
  .then(identifier => console.log('Generated Identifier:', identifier))
  .catch(error => console.error('Failed to generate identifier:', error));
```

The module uses promises to handle asynchronous operations and will reject these promises with an error code and message when something goes wrong. Handle these errors appropriately in your application to ensure reliable functionality.
