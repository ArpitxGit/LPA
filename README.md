# Blockchain Powered Local Profile Assistant App

This project is the codebase for a LPA app developed to create eSIM based wallets which allow users to interact with blockchain.
Right now this app only works on android. iOS support is planned in the future.

## Project setup

The instructions provided below are for macOS. Detailed setup instructions for react-native projects along with dependencies for other operating systems can be found [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native&platform=android)

### Node and JDK setup

This app is a react-native based app with java bridges to interface between android core API's and the react-native component.
Install node and watchman. If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 18 or newer. Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

```sh
brew install node
brew install watchman
```
We recommend installing the OpenJDK distribution called Azul Zulu.

```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew install --cask zulu17

# Get path to where cask was installed to double-click installer
brew info --cask zulu17
```

After you install the JDK, update your JAVA_HOME environment variable. If you used above steps, JDK will likely be at `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home`

If you have already installed JDK on your system, we recommend JDK 17. You may encounter problems using higher JDK versions. To make sure you are using the JDK version 17 update the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` variable to reflect the same.

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home/
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

### Setup Android Studio

[Download and Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

While on Android Studio installation wizard, make sure the boxes next to all of the following items are checked:

- Android SDK
- Android SDK Platform
- Android Virtual Device

Then, click "Next" to install all of these components.

Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default. Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the `Android 14 (UpsideDownCake)` SDK in particular. Additional Android SDKs can be installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.

To do that, open Android Studio, click on "More Actions" button and select "SDK Manager".

Select the "SDK Platforms" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the `Android 14 (UpsideDownCake)` entry, then make sure the following items are checked:

- Android SDK Platform
- `Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image` or `Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image` or (for Apple M1 Silicon) `Google APIs ARM 64 v8a System Image`

You also need to setup your environment variables to use the android utlities just installed. In your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.zprofile` (or `~/.bashrc` file if use bash shell) add the following lines

```sh
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

then run 

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify that `ANDROID_HOME` has been set by running `echo $ANDROID_HOME` and the appropriate directories have been added to your path by running `echo $PATH`.

> Please make sure you use the correct Android SDK path. You can find the actual location of the SDK in the Android Studio "Settings" dialog, under Languages & Frameworks â†’ Android SDK.

### Clone the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM/LPA.git
```

This project uses React Native's built-in command line interface. Rather than install and manage a specific version of the CLI globally, we recommend you access the current version at runtime using `npx`, which ships with Node.js. With `npx react-native <command>`, the current stable version of the CLI will be downloaded and executed at the time the command is run.

> If you previously installed a global react-native-cli package, please remove it as it may cause unexpected issues:
> ```sh 
> npm uninstall -g react-native-cli @react-native-community/cli
> ```

You will need either an Android device or setup an Android Virtual Device (AVD) to run the app.

If you have a physical android device then you can just use it by connecting to you computer and enable USB debugging. More details are available [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device)

If you plan on using an AVD for development and testing the you'll have to create one using Android Studio Device Manager.

Open `./LPA/android`, you can see the list of available Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) by opening the "AVD Manager" from within Android Studio. If you don't have any virtual device available, create a new one by following the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html). Preferred image for testing is `UpsideDownCake API Level 34 `. **Make sure that the Android version on your virtual device is greater than Android 10 (or API level 30)**

The project use some react native libraries as dependencies. Run the follwing command (from the project working directory) to make sure all required libraries are installed before your first build.

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the project

After successful installation of packages and dependencies,
Start the project by running the below command:

```sh
npm run start
```

and then press `a` to run on Android

node version 19.5.0, JDK version 17.0.1, openjdk 17.0.10 and
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu17.48+15-CA (build 17.0.10+7-LTS)

## Permissions required for Android

### List of core android services used in the project:

- https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/euicc/EuiccManager#downloadSubscription
- https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager
- https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/SubscriptionManager
- https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/SubscriptionInfo

### Add these permissions in your Android Manifest if it doesn't exist:

```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_NUMBERS"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PRECISE_PHONE_STATE"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EMBEDDED_SUBSCRIPTIONS"/>
```

eSIM services provided by the EuiccManager API needs either **carrier privileges** for regular apps or **READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE** for system apps on android.
For more details about these permissions reference
